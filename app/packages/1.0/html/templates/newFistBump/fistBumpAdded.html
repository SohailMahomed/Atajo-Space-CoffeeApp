                We want our coffee, and our love of coffee, to promote training and development among unemployed youths.
                By contributing to the training of new baristas with every cup of Blacksmith bought, you can help bring the traditional African spirit of ubuntu to modern coffee culture.
				<br /><br />
				Our trainee baristas are put through a three-month Barista Upliftment Programme where they learn all the elements necessary to becoming
				a professional barista - from the history of coffee and coffee receipes, to taste profiles and barista competition training - and the costs of the entire programme
				are covered by the proceeds from the sales of Blacksmith coffee. But that's not where the story ends - we will assist not only in the setup
				of enterprise development projects for our clients and baristas, but also in finding employment opportunities for the baristas within the coffee industry.
				<br /><br />
				Britehouse supports the Ciro ethos, one of wanting our coffee and love of coffee to promote training and development among unemployed youth.
